# Weather Check
Weather Check is a very simple practice application, building upon the call to OpenWeather's CurrentWeather API described by Uzochukwu Odozi in this video:
https://youtu.be/KT6Jaxl0JM4

What is produced in these files is a short weather report, pulling out the data returned by a JSON object, and displaying temperature, the feels like temperature, the windspeed, and the weather icon. Metric units have been used in this example, but kelvins and imperial units can also be used.

You can find the documentation for OpenWeather's Current State API here: https://openweathermap.org/current

# To make this work:
Create an account with OpenWeather, and enter your API key where it is indicated to do so in the JavaScript file.

Add your own choices of CSS, experiment with retrieving other data from the returned JSON object, 
and indeed, have fun exploring the other APIs available for your particular account.
