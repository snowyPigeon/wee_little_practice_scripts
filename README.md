# wee_little_practice_scripts
A repo for small projects - supports hackathon and technical course challenges. 

## fcc_js_algorithms_and_data_structures
I wrote the solutions for these Free Code Camp challenges in Visual Studio Code and tested my code using the [Quokka extension](https://quokkajs.com/) with console.logs.

### caesarsCipher.js
This is my solution for Caesars Cipher.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

### cashRegister.js
This is my solution for the Cash Register.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

### palindromeChecker.js
This is my solution for the Palindrome Checker.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

### romanNumeralConverter.js
This is my solution for the Roman Numeral Converter.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/roman-numeral-converter), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

### telephoneNumberValidator.js
This is my solution for the Telephone Number Validator.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

This challenge requires use of regex. I found the regex reference guide at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp) helpful when building my valid patterns.

This telephone number validator validates US telephone numbers, and I would like to write a validator for UK telephone numbers in the near future.

## Hackathon Challenges

### ListSort.cs
This is a C# program.cs file for a simple script to sort a list of names of bird species. This was for a Major League Hacking challenge in 2021.

### TwilioMessageSend.cs
simple_twilio_message_send uses a simple script from the Twilio documentation to send a marketing message for a fictional theatre, advising its customers that they can now book shows from June 21st. This was for a Major League Hacking challenge in 2021.

### Weather Check (weather-check.html and weatherCheck.js)
Weather Check is a very simple practice application, building upon the call to OpenWeather's CurrentWeather API described by Uzochukwu Odozi in this video:
https://youtu.be/KT6Jaxl0JM4

What is produced in these files is a short weather report, pulling out the data returned by a JSON object, and displaying temperature, the feels like temperature, the windspeed, and the weather icon. Metric units have been used in this example, but kelvins and imperial units can also be used.

You can find the documentation for OpenWeather's Current State API [here](https://openweathermap.org/current).

I created this for a Major League Hacking challenge around 2020/1.

To make this work:
- Create an account with OpenWeather, and enter your API key where it is indicated to do so in the JavaScript file.

- Add your own choices of CSS, experiment with retrieving other data from the returned JSON object, 
and indeed, have fun exploring the other APIs available for your particular account.
