# Weather Check
Weather Check is a very simple practice application, building upon the call to OpenWeather's CurrentWeather API described by Uzochukwu Odozi in this video:

What is produced in these files is a short weather report, pulling out the data returned by a JSON object, and displaying temperature, the feels like temperature, the windspeed, and the weather icon. Metric units have been used in this example, but kelvins and imperial units can also be used.
