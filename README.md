## Palindrome Checker
This is my solution for  Free Code Camp's JavaScript Palindrome Checker.
You can find the instructions here at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker), as part of their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects curriculum.

I wrote this in Visual Studio Code and tested my code using the [Quokka extension](https://quokkajs.com/) with console.logs.
